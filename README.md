Resources for *Ted Nelson's Vision* exhibit at VCF East 2020, Wall NJ

The exhibit "Ted Nelson's Vision" is meant to encourage visitors to look at the concepts that Ted Nelson designed starting in the 1960's and compare them to hypertext technologies that were actually implemented in the 1990s and what we currently use today.  In the exhibit, the following are demonstrated:

* JOT (Juggler of Text): Ted's design for a word processor to help writers rearrange sentences and paragraphs in a smooth intuitive way.  It was initially designed for the Nova computer using teletype input, then adapted for the Apple II computer in 1982.  It was rewritten in Forth in 1986 by Steve Witham, and can be used on the Internet archive at: https://archive.org/details/jot_0.53_ted_nelson

* Douglas Engelbart's Chord Keyboard: A homemade 5 finger chord keyboard for the left hand was constructed and connected to the Apple IIgs game port.  An Applesoft Basic program was written to demonstrate one way the chord keyboard can be used - by forming a nibble with the 4 fingers and strobing it in with the thumb.  A demo of Doug's keyboard can be seen here: https://youtu.be/t5WUBweOZA4
